**DNS (Domain Name System):**



Function: Translates human-readable domain names into machine-readable IP addresses.



Example: Packet #38 shows a standard query for www.google.com.



Analysis of Packet #38:



I have identified packet number 38 as a clear example of a Domain Name System (DNS) query. In this packet, my computer, with the source IP address 10.19.129.158, sent a request to the DNS server located at the destination IP address 10.19.129.43.



The packet details confirm that this is a "Standard query" for an "A" record corresponding to the domain name www.google.com. This means my computer was asking the DNS server for the specific IPv4 address associated with Google's website. This query is the essential first step my system takes to establish a connection with a website after I type its name into a browser.







**TCP (Transmission Control Protocol):**



Function: Provides reliable, connection-oriented data transmission for applications like web browsing.



Example: Packets #644, #646, and #648 show a complete three-way handshake.



Analysis of the Handshake:



I have identified a sequence of packets that demonstrates the TCP three-way handshake, which is how a reliable connection is established.



The process begins with Packet #644. This is the `` (synchronize) packet. My computer (source 10.19.129.158) sends this request to the server (destination 10.19.129.43) to initiate a new connection.



Next, the server responds with Packet #646. This is the `` packet. The server acknowledges my initial request and sends its own synchronize request back to my computer.



Finally, my computer completes the handshake by sending Packet #648, which is the \[ACK] (acknowledgment) packet. This confirms that the connection is successfully established from both sides.



This three-step process ensures that both devices are ready to communicate, which is fundamental to TCP's reliability. (Packet #642 appears to be a separate, earlier connection attempt).







**HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol):**



Function: Defines how data is transmitted over the internet and determines how web servers and browsers should respond to commands.



Example: Packets #4248 and #4253 show a successful HTTP request and response.



Analysis of the HTTP Traffic:



I have identified a clear example of an HTTP conversation. This interaction demonstrates the fundamental request-response model of the web.



The conversation begins with Packet #4248. This is an HTTP POST request sent from my computer (10.19.129.158) to a web server at the destination IP address 54.255.175.10. This packet represents my browser asking the server for a specific resource or sending data to it.



The server then replies with Packet #4253. This packet contains the server's response, indicated by HTTP/1.1 200 OK. The "200 OK" is a standard status code confirming that my request was received and processed successfully by the server. Together, these two packets show a complete and successful web transaction.
